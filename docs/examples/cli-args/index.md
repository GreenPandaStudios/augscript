# Command-line arguments

Read arguments, inspect collections, and return a process exit status.

Open a file to read its source beside the explanation produced by `aug spec`. **Indentation** and **Braces** display the same checked program; your choice carries across file pages.

## Project files

- [`main.aug`](main.md)


## Try this project

[Download this project](/downloads/cli-args.zip), then extract the archive in an empty working folder. It contains the checked source, configuration, and generated specs. Prepare the [native dependencies](../../packages.md#npm-registry) once, then use the published CLI:

```sh
cd cli-args
npx @greenpandastudios/aug-cli@next check .
npx @greenpandastudios/aug-cli@next spec .
npx @greenpandastudios/aug-cli@next run .
```
