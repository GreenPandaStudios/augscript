## Compiled specification {#specification}

August 0.19.0. This document is compiled from checked code. Author documentation is labeled separately. It follows Simplified Technical English as guidance, with best-effort wording.

### Folder exports

- Export the declaration `Greeter` from [`greeter.aug`](greeter.md#symbol-Greeter).


### Language rules

Boolean operations short-circuit from left to right. int uses signed 64-bit values; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and negation wrap. Division by zero raises ArithmeticError. float uses double precision. Tuples and records compare by value; mutable collections and behavioral classes compare by identity. Optional values contain a value or null; omission becomes null. Managed references grant read access; ownership moves and mutable borrows remain checked. A scope joins its child tasks; an unhandled child failure cancels siblings. See the [language reference](https://greenpandastudios.github.io/augscript/reference) for shared rules.
