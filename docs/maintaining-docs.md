# Keeping documentation current

Documentation is part of a language change. The canonical wiki is this repository's `docs` directory, reviewed and versioned with the compiler. GitHub Pages renders these same files; an independently edited GitHub Wiki would create a second source of truth.

## Where to make a change

| Change | Update in the same commit |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax, type/effect/ownership/DI rules | `docs/reference.md`, relevant grammar/testing/web guide and `src/help.ts` |
| Public library signature or behavior | Javadoc beside its declaration in `src/stdlib`, the relevant guide and gap ledger |
| Diagnostic or editor behavior | `src/help.ts`, diagnostics/tooling guide and VS Code changelog |
| CLI, packages, configuration or supported platform | Tooling/packages/releasing guide and package metadata |
| Completed or deferred feature | Implementation map, gap ledger and changelog |

Public comments should explain observable behavior, named inputs, errors, side effects, and limits. Keep dependencies explicit in examples. Record incomplete capabilities in the gap ledger; do not imply that an unimplemented proposal is usable.

## Generated reference

```sh
npm run docs:generate
npm run docs:check
npm run docs:build
```

The API generator reads each `export.aug`, resolves the actual public declaration, and uses the same Javadoc/inherited documentation path as hover. It includes public methods and excludes private native helpers. The language constructs page comes from editor help and collection operation contracts. Commit generated Markdown so GitHub readers and package users can read it without building a site. CI rejects stale generated pages.

The generator also runs the deterministic spec compiler for every standard-library source file. Commit these adjacent `src/stdlib/**/*.aug.md` files. Unlike public API pages, full source specs include private helpers and all local behavior. For application or third-party package source changes, run `aug spec PROJECT` and verify `aug spec PROJECT --check`. See [the user workflow](specifications.md).

## Executable examples

Each runnable `aug` fence declares `project=NAME file=PATH`. A guide may spread one project across several fences. Add expected output/test counts to `docs/examples.json`. The documentation test assembles, checks, runs or builds, tests, formats, and checks those projects again. API signatures use `text` fences because a declaration header is not a complete application.

```sh
node --test tests/documentation.test.mjs
```

CI checks documentation on every push and pull request. Pull requests changing language/runtime/library/tooling behavior must update a handwritten guide or changelog; the policy check enforces that requirement. The Pages deployment publishes only the documented branch version, with search and source links. Use tags and GitHub history to read earlier releases.
